# Designer-Contractor Partnership Models
## A Practical Guide for Paige & Daniel's Residential Renovation Business

---

## Executive Summary

This guide examines partnership structures for an **interior designer with heavy project management skills** (Paige) working with a **newly licensed general contractor** (Daniel) in California residential renovation. Currently operating with separate contracts, they have several options to formalize their collaboration, each with distinct advantages, risks, and financial implications.

**Key Finding:** Given Paige's dual role (design + PM) and Daniel's new license status, a **phased approach** starting with a **formalized subcontractor relationship** or **joint venture agreement** offers the best balance of flexibility, risk management, and growth potential, with a path toward full design-build integration once the partnership is proven.

---

## 1. Common Partnership Structures

### A. **Separate Contracts (Current Model)**
**Structure:** Designer and contractor each have independent contracts with the client.

**How it Works:**
- Paige contracts directly with client for design + PM services
- Daniel contracts separately with client for construction
- No formal business relationship between Paige and Daniel
- Each responsible for own liability, licensing, insurance

**Typical Fee Split:**
- Designer/PM: 15-25% of construction cost
- GC: 10-20% markup on hard costs (20-40% including overhead)

**Best For:** Testing the waters, maintaining independence

---

### B. **Referral Fee Model**
**Structure:** One party refers clients to the other and receives compensation for the referral.

**How it Works:**
- Designer refers clients to contractor (or vice versa)
- Referring party receives 10% referral fee on the contract value
- No joint liability or shared project responsibility
- Simple 1099 payment for referral

**Real Numbers:**
- Standard referral fee: **10%** of contracted amount
- On a $100,000 construction project: $10,000 referral fee
- Some designers request up to 10% markup on subcontractor bids

**Pros:**
- Simple, clean separation
- No licensing complications
- Easy to document and tax

**Cons:**
- Doesn't reflect Paige's hands-on PM role
- Undervalues ongoing collaboration
- No shared upside from efficiency gains
- May be considered kickback if not disclosed to client

**California Legal Note:** Must be disclosed to client. Interior designers can receive referral fees without licensing issues as long as they're not performing contracting work.

---

### C. **Subcontractor Agreement**
**Structure:** One party subcontracts to the other under their primary contract.

**Two Variations:**

**Option 1: Paige as Daniel's Design Subcontractor**
- Daniel holds prime contract with client for design-build services
- Paige subcontracts to Daniel for design + PM coordination
- All work flows through Daniel's contractor license
- Client pays Daniel; Daniel pays Paige per agreed schedule

**Option 2: Daniel as Paige's Construction Subcontractor**
- Paige holds prime contract for full project management
- Daniel subcontracts for construction execution under his license
- Paige coordinates all aspects; Daniel provides licensed construction
- Client pays Paige; Paige pays Daniel

**Typical Split:**
- **Option 1:** Paige receives 40-60% of design-build fee (design + PM value)
- **Option 2:** Daniel receives 70-85% of construction costs (GC fee + subs)

**Pros:**
- Single point of contact for client
- Clean contract structure
- Can test partnership dynamics
- Maintains separate business entities

**Cons:**
- Subcontractor has less control
- Prime contractor carries all liability
- May create unequal power dynamic
- More complex if relationship dissolves

---

### D. **Joint Venture (Project-Specific Partnership)**
**Structure:** Form a partnership for specific projects without creating permanent business entity.

**How it Works:**
- Create Joint Venture Agreement for each major project
- Both parties sign unified contract with client
- Revenue and expenses flow through JV
- Profits distributed per agreement (typically 40/60 to 50/50)
- JV dissolves at project completion

**Typical Profit Split Models:**
1. **50/50 Equal Partners** - simplest, works when contributions are balanced
2. **Based on Role Value:**
   - Design/PM Heavy: 60% designer / 40% contractor
   - Construction Heavy: 40% designer / 60% contractor
3. **Tiered by Project Phase:**
   - Design phase: 70% designer / 30% contractor input
   - Construction phase: 30% designer / 70% contractor

**Real-World Example:**
On a $250,000 total project with 20% combined fee ($50,000):
- Project costs: $200,000 (subs, materials, permits)
- Combined fee: $50,000
- After overhead expenses (~$15,000): $35,000 net profit
- **50/50 split:** Paige $17,500 / Daniel $17,500
- **60/40 split (design-heavy):** Paige $21,000 / Daniel $14,000

**Pros:**
- Maintains separate businesses for other work
- Flexible, project-by-project structure
- Can adjust terms as partnership evolves
- Simpler than forming an LLC
- Test compatibility without long-term commitment

**Cons:**
- Requires new agreement each project
- Shared liability (partnership law applies)
- More complex bookkeeping
- Tax reporting as partnership (K-1 forms)

**California Legal Considerations:**
- Joint venture treated as general partnership under CA law
- Both parties liable for partnership debts and obligations
- Need clear operating agreement for each project
- Formal partnership agreement strongly recommended

---

### E. **Design-Build LLC**
**Structure:** Form permanent Limited Liability Company to deliver integrated design-build services.

**How it Works:**
- Create California LLC (e.g., "Paige Daniel Design-Build, LLC")
- File operating agreement defining ownership, roles, profit splits
- LLC holds contractor license (Daniel as Responsible Managing Employee/RME)
- Single contract with clients for design + construction
- Shared liability protection
- Operating agreement governs all decisions

**Typical Ownership Structures:**
1. **Equal 50/50 Ownership** - partnership of equals
2. **51/49 Design-Led** - designer has controlling interest
3. **51/49 Contractor-Led** - contractor has controlling interest
4. **60/40 or 70/30** - reflects capital contribution or revenue generation

**Fee Structure for Design-Build:**
- Combined fee: **15-30% of total project cost**
- Industry average: **20-25%** for residential remodel/renovation
- Breakdown typically:
  - Design services: 8-12%
  - Project management: 5-8%
  - GC coordination & overhead: 7-10%

**Real-World Example:**
$300,000 renovation project, 22% combined fee:
- Total fee: $66,000
- Overhead/expenses: ~$20,000
- Net profit: $46,000
- **50/50 split:** Each receives $23,000
- **Based on hours worked:** If Paige works 250 hours and Daniel works 150 hours
  - Paige: $28,750 (62.5%)
  - Daniel: $17,250 (37.5%)

**Pros:**
- **Single point of contact** for client (huge selling point)
- Liability protection (LLC shield)
- Professional, unified brand
- Better financing options
- Easier to scale and hire employees
- Tax flexibility (S-corp or partnership taxation)
- Integrated design-construction from day one
- Studies show 12% faster completion vs separate contracts

**Cons:**
- More complex formation and maintenance
- Annual LLC fees and compliance ($800+ CA franchise tax)
- Requires operating agreement and clear governance
- Harder to dissolve if partnership doesn't work
- Both parties "locked in" to shared business
- Need clear buy-out provisions

**Legal Requirements in California:**
- File Articles of Organization with CA Secretary of State
- Create detailed Operating Agreement
- Obtain EIN from IRS
- CSLB contractor license under LLC name (Daniel as RME)
- Business insurance (general liability, errors & omissions, workers comp)
- Annual $800 minimum franchise tax

---

### F. **Design-Build Corporation (Alternative to LLC)**
**Structure:** Form a California Corporation instead of LLC.

**Key Differences from LLC:**
- More formal structure (board of directors, corporate officers)
- Double taxation (corporate + personal) unless S-corp election
- More regulatory requirements
- Better for raising outside capital
- Easier to add multiple stakeholders

**When to Consider:** If planning major growth, outside investment, or eventual sale. For a two-person partnership, **LLC is typically better suited**.

## 2. How Design-Build Partnerships Split Duties & Profit

### Typical Responsibility Matrix

| Function | Designer-PM (Paige) | GC (Daniel) | Shared |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Client relationship** | Lead | Support | ✓ |
| **Initial design concepts** | Lead | Input | |
| **Space planning & CAD** | 100% | Review | |
| **Material selection** | Lead | Cost input | ✓ |
| **Permit drawings** | Prep | Submit* | ✓ |
| **Budget development** | Input | Lead | ✓ |
| **Subcontractor bidding** | Review | Lead | ✓ |
| **Schedule creation** | Input | Lead | ✓ |
| **Site supervision** | As needed | Daily | ✓ |
| **Trade coordination** | Strategic | Tactical | ✓ |
| **Quality control** | Design intent | Construction | ✓ |
| **Change orders** | Design impact | Cost/schedule | ✓ |
| **Client communication** | Design decisions | Construction updates | ✓ |
| **Punch list** | Design review | Execute | ✓ |

*CA Note: Only licensed contractors can pull permits for structural work; designers can submit non-structural plans.

### Real-World Profit Split Approaches

**Method 1: Gross Revenue Percentage**
- Calculate total project fee (e.g., 20% of $300K = $60,000)
- Split based on agreed percentage (50/50, 60/40, etc.)
- Simple but doesn't account for effort variation by project

**Method 2: Role-Based Compensation**
- Designer/PM: Flat fee or % for design + hourly PM rate
- GC: Markup on all construction costs + fixed fee
- Example:
  - Design fee: $15,000 flat (Paige)
  - PM hourly: $85/hr × 200 hours = $17,000 (Paige)
  - GC fee: 15% × $200K = $30,000 (Daniel)
  - Total: $62,000 | Split: Paige $32K (52%) / Daniel $30K (48%)

**Method 3: Time-Based Split** (tracks actual effort)
- Track all hours worked by each partner
- Set blended hourly rate goals
- Distribute profit proportional to hours invested
- Good for early partnership when roles are evolving

**Method 4: Hybrid** (most common in mature partnerships)
- Base salary or guaranteed minimum for each partner
- Remaining profit split by agreed %
- Example:
  - Paige base: $5,000/project
  - Daniel base: $5,000/project
  - Remaining profit: 50/50
  - Ensures minimum compensation regardless of profit

### What's Fair for Designer Doing Design + PM?

Traditional fee breakdowns:
- **Interior design only:** 10-15% of project cost
- **Project management only:** 5-10% of project cost
- **Design + PM combined:** 15-25% of project cost
- **GC markup:** 10-20% (varies by overhead)

**For Paige's dual role:**
Given she's doing design, CAD, site visits, trade coordination, material sourcing, and on-job decisions, **fair compensation is 18-25% of construction cost** OR **55-65% of combined design-build fee**.

**Example:** On $250,000 renovation with 22% total fee ($55,000):
- **60/40 split:** Paige $33,000 / Daniel $22,000
- This reflects Paige's dual value-add (design + substantial PM)
- Daniel's 40% covers GC coordination, scheduling, permit management, and trade supervision

**Key Factors to Negotiate:**
1. Who handles client communication (primary contact role = higher value)
2. Who manages finances/billing (bookkeeping burden)
3. Who provides insurance, bonding (direct costs)
4. Who brings in the clients (business development value)
5. Geographic market rates (higher in coastal CA cities)

## 3. How Delegated Authority Over Crews is Formalized

### The Core Question
When Paige is on-site making decisions, how does she direct Daniel's subcontractors without creating liability issues or undermining Daniel's license?

### Legal Framework in California

**The License Holder's Responsibility:**
- Daniel, as the licensed contractor, is **legally responsible** for all work performed
- CA Contractors State License Board (CSLB) holds Daniel accountable for:
  - Code compliance
  - Proper permits
  - Worker safety
  - Quality of work
  - Subcontractor supervision

**Non-Licensed PM Authority:**
Paige can perform construction management functions **without a license** on private residential projects, including:
- Scheduling and coordinating trades
- Communicating design intent
- Reviewing quality against plans
- Reporting issues to Daniel
- Making design-related decisions
- Advising on material substitutions

**What Paige CANNOT do without Daniel's license:**
- Enter into contracts with subcontractors
- Pull building permits (except non-structural)
- Direct structural work without Daniel's approval
- Hire or fire subcontractors
- Approve payment to subs directly

### Formalizing the Authority Structure

**Document 1: Project Management Agreement**
Attached to each client contract, defines:
- Paige's role as Design-Project Manager
- Daniel's role as Licensed General Contractor
- Decision-making hierarchy for:
  - Design changes (Paige lead, Daniel input on cost/feasibility)
  - Schedule changes (Joint decision)
  - Budget changes (Joint decision, Daniel final approval)
  - Safety issues (Daniel has final authority)
  - Code compliance (Daniel has final authority)

**Document 2: Subcontractor Notification Letter**
Given to all subs at project start:
```
"[Paige] is the Design-Project Manager for this project and is authorized 
to provide design direction, coordinate schedules, and review work quality. 
All work must comply with plans and specifications. [Daniel], as the 
licensed general contractor, maintains final authority over all construction 
means and methods, and approves all payments. Questions regarding site 
safety, code compliance, or contractual matters should be directed to 
[Daniel]."
```

**Document 3: Authority Matrix**
Create a simple chart showing decision rights:

| Decision Type | Paige Authority | Daniel Authority | Joint Decision |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Design changes | Approve (within budget) | Cost input | If over 10% budget impact |
| Material substitutions | Design approval | Feasibility/cost | If affects schedule |
| Schedule adjustments | Recommend | Final approval | Major changes |
| Subcontractor performance | Report issues | Manage/replace | Termination |
| Payment approvals | Quality sign-off | Release payment | |
| Change orders | Design impact | Price/schedule | Client approval |
| Safety issues | Report | Final authority | |

**Best Practice: Weekly Coordination Meeting**
- Paige and Daniel meet (in person or call) weekly
- Review upcoming week's schedule
- Discuss any issues or changes
- Align on client communication
- Document decisions in shared project log

**Insurance Considerations:**
- Daniel's contractor general liability must cover Paige's PM activities
- Consider adding Paige as "additional insured" on Daniel's policy
- Paige should carry professional liability (E&O) insurance for design work
- Operating agreement should specify who pays for what insurance

---

## 4. Legal Considerations in California

### California Contractor Licensing (CSLB)

**Class B - General Building Contractor License**
- Daniel must hold active Class B license
- Allows him to construct/remodel structures for human occupancy
- Requires two or more unrelated trades
- Required for projects over $500 (labor + materials)
- Daniel must be the Responsible Managing Employee (RME) or Responsible Managing Officer (RMO)

**New B-2 Residential Remodeling License** (as of 2024)
- Specifically for residential remodeling contractors
- May be more appropriate for Paige & Daniel's focus
- Covers residential remodeling and improvement projects

### Does Paige Need a License?

**Short Answer: No** - for her current role, but with important caveats.

**What Paige CAN do without a contractor license:**
1. **Interior Design Work**
   - Under CA Business & Professions Code §5800-5812
   - "Certified Interior Designer" can prepare and submit non-structural/non-seismic plans
   - Can prepare plans "of sufficient complexity to require licensed contractor to implement"
   - Can engage in "programming, planning, designing, documenting construction"
   
2. **Construction Management on Private Projects**
   - CA case law (Fifth Day, LLC v. Bolotin, 2009) clarified this
   - Construction managers on **private residential projects** do NOT need contractor license IF:
     - They don't contract to perform actual construction
     - They don't hire subs directly (contract basis)
     - They provide advisory, coordination, scheduling, budgeting services
     - They don't "construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve..."
   
3. **Project Management Services Allowed:**
   - Schedule creation and coordination
   - Budget development and monitoring
   - Design review and quality control
   - Coordination with trades (under GC's authority)
   - Site inspections and reporting
   - Material sourcing and recommendations
   - Client communication
   - Documentation and reporting

**What Paige CANNOT do without license:**
- Enter contracts for construction work (must be under Daniel's license)
- Pull permits for structural work
- Directly hire or fire subcontractors
- Perform any hands-on construction work
- Bid construction work in her own name

**Important Distinction:**
- **Public projects:** Construction managers MUST be licensed architect, engineer, or contractor (Gov Code § 4525(e))
- **Private projects:** No such requirement (but must not perform actual contracting)

**Working Under Daniel's License:**
- Paige can do extensive PM work as Daniel's agent/employee/partner
- All work must be done in connection with Daniel's license
- Contracts must be in Daniel's name or joint venture name
- Daniel remains legally responsible for all work
- CSLB requires Daniel to have "direct supervision and control"

**When Paige WOULD Need a License:**
If the partnership evolves to where Paige wants to:
- Pull permits independently
- Contract for construction in her own name
- Operate independently when Daniel is unavailable
- Take on projects without Daniel

Then she would need to:
- Pass CSLB exams (Law & Trade)
- Document 4 years of journey-level experience
- Obtain her own Class B license

**Practical Recommendation:**
For now, Paige does NOT need a license. However, if the partnership succeeds and they're doing 4+ projects/year, **Paige should consider getting licensed** within 2-3 years to:
- Increase business resilience (two licensed professionals)
- Expand project capacity
- Provide backup if Daniel is unavailable
- Strengthen professional credibility

### CSLB Compliance for the Partnership

**Joint License Options:**

**Option A: License Under Daniel's Name** (Current Status)
- Daniel is sole RME (Responsible Managing Employee)
- Simplest structure
- Daniel personally liable for all work
- Fine for testing partnership

**Option B: License Under LLC Name**
- If forming design-build LLC
- Daniel listed as RME for the LLC
- LLC holds the license (provides more entity protection)
- Requires updating CSLB registration

**Option C: Both Licensed** (Future State)
- Both Paige and Daniel become licensed
- Significantly increases business capacity and resilience
- Each can RME different projects simultaneously
- Best for mature, growing partnership

**Key CSLB Rules to Follow:**
1. **Supervision Requirement:** Daniel must provide "direct supervision and control" over all work
2. **Contracting Limit:** Cannot contract for work over license classification
3. **Insurance:** Must maintain required insurance (varies by bond amount)
4. **Advertising:** Any business name must include license number
5. **Disclosure:** All contracts must include:
   - License number
   - Name and address
   - Start/completion dates
   - Payment schedule

- ❌ Must align on all major decisions

**BEST FOR:** Proven partnership (6+ months, 5+ projects), high-volume pipeline, serious about building a brand, ready to commit long-term.

**RECOMMENDATION FOR PAIGE & DANIEL:** Strong option after 12-18 months of successful collaboration, once you've established:
- Compatible work styles
- Clear role definitions
- Trust in each other's judgment
- Consistent deal flow
- Shared vision for growth

---

## 6. Transition Strategy: From Separate to Unified

### **Recommended Phased Approach for Paige & Daniel**

Given:
- Daniel is new to his own license
- Current model is separate contracts
- Existing projects in flight
- Need to test long-term compatibility

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Separate Contracts (Months 1-6)**
**Current state + coordination improvements**

**Actions:**
1. Continue separate client contracts
2. Create **Partnership MOU** (Memorandum of Understanding):
   - State intent to collaborate closely
   - Define role boundaries
   - Set communication protocols
   - Establish joint marketing approach
3. Implement weekly coordination meetings
4. Start tracking hours/effort by project (build data)
5. Create unified marketing materials that show collaboration
6. Client communication: Position as "integrated team"

**Financial Model:**
- Each bills own contract value
- Optional: Small referral fee (5%) to whoever brings the client
- Track: What's each person's actual contribution worth?

**Goals:**
- Complete 3-5 projects together successfully
- Establish working rhythm and trust
- Identify friction points
- Validate that you want to deepen partnership

**Exit Path:** If it's not working, easy to part ways with no business entanglements.

---

### **Phase 2: Formalized Subcontractor Model (Months 7-18)**
**Test unified client contract**

**Actions:**
1. Choose structure: **Daniel as Prime, Paige as Design-PM Sub**
   - Rationale: Daniel's license must be on permit anyway
   - Easier for client to pay one licensed contractor
   - Paige maintains design authority via subcontract
2. Draft **Master Subcontract Agreement** between Paige and Daniel
3. New projects use unified contract:
   - Client contracts with Daniel (or joint venture)
   - Paige's scope explicitly described in prime contract
   - Payment flows through Daniel to Paige
4. Set initial split: **60% Paige / 40% Daniel** (adjust based on Phase 1 data)
5. Create standard **Authority Matrix** and Sub Notification Letter
6. Both carry appropriate insurance (add each other as named insured)

**Financial Model:**
- Project fee: 20-25% of construction cost
- Split after expenses: 60/40 or 55/45 (favor design-PM role)
- Track hours to validate split is fair

**Client Benefit:**
- "One contract covers your entire project"
- "Integrated team from design through completion"
- "No finger-pointing if issues arise"

**Goals:**
- Complete 5-8 projects under unified structure
- Refine role definitions and decision-making
- Test profit-sharing model
- Build unified brand recognition

**Exit Path:** Subcontract can be terminated with 30-60 days notice. Current projects complete, future projects revert to separate.

---

### **Phase 3A: Joint Venture or Phase 3B: Design-Build LLC (Month 18+)**
**Commit to long-term partnership structure**

**Decision Point:** After 12-18 months, evaluate:
- ✅ Do we work well together?
- ✅ Do we trust each other's judgment?
- ✅ Do we have consistent deal flow (4+ projects/year)?
- ✅ Do we want to grow this into a brand?
- ✅ Do clients value the integrated approach?
- ✅ Are we both better off together than separate?

**If YES → Choose Your Model:**

**Option A: Joint Venture** (Less commitment)
- Good if: Want to keep separate businesses for other work
- Create JV agreement template for projects
- Form project-specific JV for each client
- Can still do separate projects outside JV

**Option B: Design-Build LLC** (Full commitment)
- Good if: Want to build a unified brand and scale
- Form California LLC ("Paige Daniel Design-Build, LLC")
- Transfer Daniel's license to LLC (or get new one)
- Create comprehensive Operating Agreement:
  - Ownership split (50/50 or based on capital/effort)
  - Profit distribution (after salaries)
  - Decision-making rules (what requires unanimous consent)
  - Buy-out provisions (if one wants to leave)
  - Dissolution terms
- Set up business infrastructure:
  - Bank accounts
  - Accounting system
  - Insurance policies
  - Contracts and templates
  - Brand identity

**Financial Model (LLC):**
- **Owner salaries:** Set reasonable draw for each partner
  - Paige: $X per project or $Y annual salary
  - Daniel: $X per project or $Y annual salary
- **Profit distribution:** After salaries and expenses
  - Split per ownership % (e.g., 50/50)
  - Or performance-based (more projects = more profit share)

**Example LLC Financials:**
- Year 1 revenue (8 projects): $400,000
- Operating expenses: $120,000
- Partner salaries (each): $80,000 ($160,000 total)
- Net profit: $120,000
- **50/50 split:** Each receives $80K salary + $60K profit = $140K total

**LLC Formation Costs (CA):**
- Filing fees: ~$100
- Operating Agreement (attorney): $2,000-$5,000
- First year franchise tax: $800
- Insurance setup: $2,000-$5,000
- Accounting/bookkeeping: $2,000-$5,000/year
- **Total startup:** ~$7,000-$16,000

---

### **Handling Current/In-Flight Projects During Transition**

**Key Principle:** Don't disrupt active projects. Transition applies to NEW contracts only.

**Strategy:**
1. **Projects Already Under Contract:** Complete under existing structure
   - Honor existing client agreements
   - Don't try to amend mid-stream
   - Maintain current payment flows

2. **Projects in Design Phase:** Assess case-by-case
   - If no contract signed yet: Can propose new unified structure
   - Position as: "We've formalized our partnership to serve you better"
   - Client benefit: Single point of accountability
   - Give client option to stay with original proposal

3. **New Clients:** Present unified model
   - Market as: "Integrated Design-Build Team"
   - Single contract, single point of contact
   - Clear scope, schedule, and pricing

**Communication Script for Existing Clients:**
> "We wanted to let you know that Paige and Daniel have formalized our partnership to provide even better integrated service. For your project, nothing changes—we'll continue with our current contracts and team approach. For future projects, we'll be offering a streamlined design-build contract that many clients find simpler and more efficient."

**Do NOT:**
- ❌ Try to combine existing separate contracts into one
- ❌ Change payment terms mid-project
- ❌ Confuse clients with entity changes during their project
- ❌ Rush the transition—better to phase slowly

## 7. Practical Recommendations for Paige & Daniel

### **Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)**

1. **Create Partnership MOU**
   - Document current working relationship
   - Define roles and boundaries
   - Set communication protocols
   - Establish which model you're targeting long-term

2. **Implement Coordination Systems**
   - Weekly project review meetings (every Monday 9am)
   - Shared project management tool (Buildertrend, CoConstruct, or Airtable)
   - Shared client communication log
   - Decision documentation system

3. **Track Financial Data**
   - Start logging hours by project and task
   - Track what % of time each person spends on what
   - Document which person brings in which clients
   - This data will inform fair profit splits

4. **Align on Pricing**
   - Set standard combined fee structure (e.g., 22% of construction cost)
   - Decide interim split for next few projects
   - Recommendation: 60% Paige / 40% Daniel (reflects design + heavy PM)
   - Revisit after 3 projects

5. **Get Proper Insurance**
   - Daniel: Verify General Liability covers Paige's PM activities
   - Paige: Obtain Professional Liability (E&O) for design work
   - Consider adding each other as "additional insured"
   - Consult insurance broker about partnership coverage

### **6-Month Decisions (After 3-5 Projects)**

**Evaluate:**
- Are we working well together?
- Are we getting more done together than separately?
- Do clients value the integrated approach?
- Is the financial split feeling fair?
- Do we both want to go deeper?

**If YES:**
- Move to Phase 2 (Subcontractor model)
- Draft Master Subcontract Agreement
- Create Authority Matrix
- Set up unified client contract template
- Consider joint marketing (website, collateral)

**If NO or UNCERTAIN:**
- Stay in current model longer
- Identify what needs to improve
- Set specific goals and check in again in 3 months

### **12-18 Month Decisions (After 8-10 Projects)**

**Evaluate:**
- Track record of successful projects?
- Consistent deal flow?
- Trust and compatible work styles?
- Ready to commit long-term?
- Want to build a brand together?

**If YES → Form LLC:**
- Hire attorney to draft Operating Agreement
- File LLC with California Secretary of State
- Transfer contractor license to LLC
- Set up business bank accounts, accounting, insurance
- Create brand identity
- Launch unified marketing

**If SATISFIED BUT NOT READY FOR LLC:**
- Continue with formalized JV or subcontractor model
- Set another check-in for 6 months

### **Financial Target Setting**

**Year 1 Goals (Separate/Subcontractor Model):**
- Complete 6-8 projects
- Average project size: $175,000-$250,000 construction
- Combined revenue: $275,000-$400,000
- After expenses:
  - Paige: $90,000-$150,000
  - Daniel: $60,000-$100,000

**Year 2 Goals (JV or LLC Model):**
- Complete 10-12 projects
- Average project size: $200,000-$300,000
- Combined revenue: $440,000-$660,000
- LLC structure with salaries + profit share
- Hire first employee (project coordinator or junior PM)

**Year 3 Goals (Mature Design-Build Firm):**
- Complete 15-20 projects
- Multiple projects running simultaneously
- Average project size: $250,000+
- Combined revenue: $750,000-$1M+
- Small team (2-3 employees)
- Established brand recognition

### **Key Negotiation Points to Discuss Now**

1. **Profit Split Philosophy**
   - Equal partners (50/50) or weighted by role?
   - Based on hours worked or value delivered?
   - Adjust per project or set standard?

2. **Decision-Making Authority**
   - What decisions require both to agree?
   - Who has final say on design? On construction methods? On hiring?
   - How do we handle deadlock?

3. **Client Origination**
   - Does it matter who brings in the client?
   - Referral bonus or same split regardless?

4. **Time Commitment**
   - Are both full-time on this partnership or maintaining other work?
   - What happens if one person wants to take on outside projects?

5. **Growth Vision**
   - Do we want to stay small (2-3 people) or grow to 10+ employees?
   - Are we building a lifestyle business or something to sell eventually?

6. **Exit Strategy**
   - What if one person wants out?
   - Buy-out formula? (e.g., 1x annual profit)
   - Non-compete provisions?

### **Red Flags to Watch For**

⚠️ **Signs the partnership may not work:**
- One person consistently feels undervalued
- Frequent disagreements over design vs cost trade-offs
- Client feedback that they're getting mixed messages
- One partner doing significantly more work than split reflects
- Lack of trust in each other's decisions
- One person making decisions without consulting the other
- Money stress or disagreements over billing/payment

If these arise: **Address immediately**. Don't let resentment build. Consider bringing in a business coach or mediator.

### **Success Factors**

✅ **Signs the partnership is thriving:**
- Clients comment on how well you work together
- Projects coming in on time and budget more consistently
- Both partners excited about the work
- Natural division of labor emerging
- Referrals from happy clients
- Revenue per project increasing (efficiency gains)
- Both learning from each other

## 8. Sample Financial Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: $200,000 Residential Kitchen + Bath Remodel**

**Separate Contracts (Current Model):**
- Design fee (Paige): 15% of $200K = $30,000
- GC fee (Daniel): 18% of $165K hard costs = $29,700
- Total professional fees: $59,700
- Paige net (after expenses): ~$22,000
- Daniel net (after overhead): ~$18,000

**Subcontractor Model (Phase 2):**
- Combined fee: 22% of $200K = $44,000
- Project expenses: $8,000
- Net profit: $36,000
- **60/40 split:** Paige $21,600 / Daniel $14,400

**Design-Build LLC (Phase 3):**
- Combined fee: 24% of $200K = $48,000
- Operating expenses: $10,000
- Owner draws: $6,000 each ($12,000 total)
- Net profit: $26,000
- **50/50 split:** Each gets $6K + $13K = **$19,000 total**

---

### **Scenario 2: $400,000 Whole House Renovation**

**Separate Contracts:**
- Design fee (Paige): 12% of $400K = $48,000
- GC fee (Daniel): 16% of $340K hard costs = $54,400
- Total professional fees: $102,400
- Paige net: ~$35,000
- Daniel net: ~$32,000

**Joint Venture Model:**
- Combined fee: 20% of $400K = $80,000

- Operating expenses: $22,000
- Owner salaries: $15,000 each ($30,000 total)
- Net profit: $36,000
- **50/50 split:** Each gets $15K salary + $18K profit = **$33,000 total**

---

### **Key Insights from Scenarios:**

1. **Larger projects favor unified models** - Overhead as % decreases, profit increases
2. **Paige's dual role (design + PM) justifies 55-65% of profit** in split scenarios
3. **LLC structure creates more overhead** but builds enterprise value
4. **Efficiency gains** (12% faster construction, fewer change orders) improve margins over time
5. **Gross revenue isn't everything** - Net profit and work-life balance matter more

## 10. Final Recommendations for Paige & Daniel

### **Recommended Path Forward:**

**Short Term (Next 6 Months):**
→ **Formalized Subcontractor Model** (Daniel prime, Paige design-PM sub)
- Easiest transition from current state
- Single client contract (less confusing for clients)
- Tests partnership dynamics without full merger
- **Profit split: 60% Paige / 40% Daniel** (reflects design + extensive PM)
- Review every 3 projects; adjust if needed

**Medium Term (6-18 Months):**
→ **Project-Specific Joint Venture** OR Continue Refined Subcontractor
- After 5-8 successful projects, evaluate if JV feels more equitable
- JV benefits: True partnership, shared decision-making
- OR stay with subcontractor if it's working well and less admin burden
- Either way, formalize authority matrix and coordination protocols

**Long Term (18+ Months):**
→ **Design-Build LLC** (if partnership is thriving)
- Form when you have consistent deal flow (8+ projects/year)
- Ready to invest in brand building
- Want to hire employees and scale
- Trust and compatibility proven
- **Ownership: 50/50 or 55/45** (reflecting business dev contribution)

### **Why This Progression Makes Sense:**

1. **De-risks the partnership** - Test before committing to LLC
2. **Easier exit** - If Phase 1 doesn't work, minimal entanglement
3. **Builds trust incrementally** - Each phase deepens collaboration
4. **Allows for course correction** - Adjust splits and roles as you learn
5. **Protects current projects** - No disruption to existing clients
6. **Natural evolution** - Mirrors how many successful design-build firms started

### **Deal-Breakers to Avoid:**

❌ Don't jump straight to LLC without testing partnership dynamics
❌ Don't let one person carry all the risk (must be fair)
❌ Don't skip legal agreements (even between friends)
❌ Don't ignore red flags in early projects (address issues immediately)
❌ Don't underprice to win work (damages market and your value)

### **Success Metrics to Track:**

✅ Client satisfaction (referrals, repeat business, testimonials)
✅ Project profitability (are you making target margins?)
✅ On-time/on-budget delivery (% of projects meeting goals)
✅ Personal satisfaction (do you both enjoy the work?)
✅ Revenue growth (are you attracting larger/better projects?)
✅ Efficiency gains (are projects faster/smoother than before?)

## Conclusion

**For Paige and Daniel's situation**, the optimal approach is:

1. **Start conservatively** with formalized subcontractor relationship (Daniel prime, Paige sub)
2. **Test the partnership** over 6-12 months and 5-8 projects
3. **Build trust and systems** through structured coordination
4. **Transition to LLC** only when proven successful and ready to scale
5. **Adjust profit splits** to fairly compensate Paige's dual design + PM role (60/40 or 55/45)

The design-build market is strong—studies show 40% of non-residential construction and growing residential adoption. Clients value single-point accountability and integrated delivery. With Paige's design + PM skills and Daniel's licensing and construction expertise, you have a compelling value proposition.

**The key is not rushing.** Take time to build a foundation of trust, systems, and successful projects before committing to the complexity and permanence of an LLC structure.
