# LO Buddy — Sprint 1: Audit, Triage & Core Fixes

**Created:** 2026-02-26 by Jasper (from Kyle hopper Q&A)
**For:** Chad (implementation) + Kyle (review/confirm)
**Branch:** `feature/jasper` → PR to `main` when complete
**Model:** Use `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-opus-4-6 claude` for all Claude Code sessions
**Review:** Cross-model reviewed before delivery ✓

---

## Context: Why This Sprint Exists

Kyle's Q&A session surfaced the core problem: **nobody knows what actually works.**
Features are half-done, agents are opaque, and there's no test harness. The codebase
is far more built-out than it appears (40+ services, full agent module system, Pinecone
client, memory retrieval — all exist), but nothing has been verified end-to-end.

**Rule for this sprint:** Do not add new features. Fix, verify, and wire what exists.
The next sprint (scenarios, rate stack, GHL webhooks) depends on this one being clean.

---

## Part 1: Known Bugs — Fix These First (Plan 13)

These bugs were identified in smoke testing. They are critical and blocking MVP.

### Bug 1: Duplicate Lead Creation
**File:** `services/tool-calling-agent.service.ts`, `services/command-execution.service.ts`, `lib/llm/prompt-cache.ts`

Before calling `create_lead`, check if a contact with the same name exists in the
current conversation context. If found, switch to `manage_contact` with `action='update'`.

Add to system prompt: *"If the user has already created a lead in this session,
subsequent information about that person should UPDATE the existing lead, not create
a new one."*

**Acceptance:** Create "Mike Thompson" then say "His email is mike@test.com" — should
result in 1 contact with both fields, not 2 contacts.

---

### Bug 2: Realtor Fuzzy Match — CRITICAL
**File:** `services/user-search.service.ts`

Current scoring resolves "Chad Anderson" to "Chad Test" because first-name match
alone passes the threshold. Fix: when searching with a full name (2+ parts), require
**both** first AND last to match.

```typescript
if (nameParts.length >= 2) {
  const firstMatches = firstName.toLowerCase() === nameParts[0].toLowerCase();
  const lastMatches = lastName.toLowerCase() === nameParts.slice(1).join(' ').toLowerCase();
  if (firstMatches && lastMatches) score = 80;
  else if (firstMatches && !lastMatches) score = 0; // NOT a match
}
```

When realtor is `not_found`, agent should offer to create them — never silently skip.

**Add `create_realtor` tool:**
- Parameters: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email?`, `phone?`, `company?`, `link_to_opportunity_id?`
- After creation, AI asks: "Do you have their contact info?"
- Files: `services/command-execution.service.ts`, `services/tool-calling-agent.service.ts`, `lib/llm/prompt-cache.ts`

**Acceptance:** "New lead: Jane Doe, referred by realtor Chad Anderson" → realtor
"Chad Anderson" created, linked to opportunity, AI asks for their contact info.
"Chad Test" must NOT be matched.

---

### Bug 3: Realtor Referral Prompt Missing
**Files:** `services/command-execution.service.ts`, `lib/llm/prompt-cache.ts`

After creating a lead:
1. If `lead_source` is not set → ask "How were they referred?"
2. If user mentions a person → trigger realtor lookup/creation
3. If `referring_realtor_id` not set after realtor-type referral → ask for name

**Acceptance:** "New lead: Sarah Johnson, purchase" → AI asks about referral source.
Answer "realtor referral" → AI asks for realtor name.

---

### Bug 4: Post-Lead-Creation Navigation
**Files:** `app/api/voice/chat/route.ts`, `components/voice/voice-context.tsx`

Add debug logging to confirm `createdOpportunityId` and `navigateTo` are populated
and that `router.push` fires on the client. Per existing logs, navigation MAY be
working — confirm first before rewriting.

If confirmed broken: verify opportunity is actually being created (vs contact-only),
and that `navigateTo` is in the API response.

**Acceptance:** "New lead: Test User, purchase" → browser navigates to
`/opportunities/[new-id]` within 2 seconds of AI confirmation.

---

## Part 2: Voice UI Reconciliation

**Problem:** There are two chat interfaces:
1. Pink floating blob (corner button)
2. Standard chat interface

These need to be reconciled into **one unified interface**. Kyle's intent is
voice-first — the LO should be able to dictate to LO Buddy naturally.

**What to do:**
- Audit both components: what does each do, what APIs does each call?
- Determine which is more complete and battle-tested
- Merge the best of both into a single voice-first chat UI
- The pink blob UI should be the primary entry point OR it should go away entirely
- Document your finding before merging — ask Kyle which direction if unclear

**Files to audit:**
- `components/voice/` (all files)
- `app/(auth)/voice-test/` 
- `app/(auth)/chat/`
- `app/api/voice/chat/route.ts` vs any other chat route

**Acceptance:** One chat interface, voice-first, no duplicate entry points.

---

## Part 3: System Audit — What's Actually Live

For each item below, verify it works end-to-end. Mark status, note what's broken.
Do NOT fix anything outside Part 1 this sprint — just audit and document.

### 3A. Memory System (Pinecone + Supabase)

The files exist:
- `lib/memory/pinecone-client.ts` — Pinecone client, `lo-buddy-memory` index
- `lib/memory/embeddings.ts` — OpenAI embedding wrapper
- `services/memory-retrieval.service.ts` — Tier 2 (Supabase) + Tier 3 (Pinecone)
- `services/memory-write.service.ts` — Write path

**Audit checklist:**
- [ ] Is `PINECONE_API_KEY` set in Vercel environment? (check Vercel dashboard)
- [ ] Does the `lo-buddy-memory` Pinecone index actually exist? (Pinecone console)
- [ ] Is `memory-retrieval.service.ts` called anywhere in the chat API route?
- [ ] Is `memory-write.service.ts` called anywhere after chat completion?
- [ ] Run: create a test conversation, check if any vectors appear in Pinecone
- [ ] If nothing is wired: memory system is built but not connected — flag for Sprint 2

**Note:** Do NOT build new memory infrastructure this sprint. Just verify if what
exists is connected. The full Pinecone port plan is at:
`/data/shared/projects/lo-buddy/02-25-26/JASPER-PINECONE-PORT.md`

---

### 3B. Agent Module System

Files exist under `services/agent-modules/`:
- `module-selector.service.ts`
- `prompt-composer.ts`
- `modules/` (individual modules)
- `capture-pipeline.ts`
- `proactive-engine.ts`

**Audit checklist:**
- [ ] Is `module-selector.service.ts` actually called in `tool-calling-agent.service.ts`?
- [ ] Is `prompt-composer.ts` wired into the LLM call path?
- [ ] Which modules exist in `modules/`? List them.
- [ ] Does the agent actually switch behavior based on context (lead capture vs follow-up coach)?
- [ ] Test: "New lead: John Smith" — does it route to the Capture module?
- [ ] Test: "What should I do with my stale leads?" — does it route to Follow-Up Coach?

---

### 3C. GHL (LO Ninja) Integration

Files:
- `services/ghl-conversation-sync.service.ts`
- `services/ghl-draft.service.ts`
- `lib/integrations/lo-ninja/`
- `app/api/integrations/` (check if GHL webhook route exists)

**Audit checklist:**
- [ ] Is `LO_NINJA_API_KEY` set in Vercel environment?
- [ ] Does a GHL webhook endpoint exist? (e.g., `app/api/integrations/ghl/webhook/route.ts`)
- [ ] Does `ghl-conversation-sync.service.ts` pull conversations from GHL?
- [ ] Can it access call recordings from LO Ninja? (needed for call transcription)
- [ ] Is any GHL data flowing into the app in production?

**Note:** GHL webhook integration is Sprint 1 top priority per Kyle (Q1). If the
webhook endpoint doesn't exist, that's the primary build item for this sprint.

---

### 3D. Voice Transcription

Files:
- `app/api/voice/transcribe/route.ts`
- `lib/utils/voice-transcription-normalizer.ts`
- `types/voice.types.ts`

**Audit checklist:**
- [ ] Does the transcription endpoint accept audio and return text?
- [ ] Is it wired to the voice chat UI?
- [ ] Is Whisper being used? What model?
- [ ] Does it handle mortgage-domain corrections (rate names, loan types, etc.)?
- [ ] Test with a real voice recording if possible

---

### 3E. Scenario Service

File: `services/scenario.service.ts`, `app/api/scenarios/`

**Audit checklist:**
- [ ] Can the LLM create scenarios via voice? ("Give me a conventional purchase scenario for $500k")
- [ ] Does scenario overwrite work? (Per Plan 13 logs: YES — this appears to work)
- [ ] Are scenarios viewable in the UI?
- [ ] Is there a scenario detail/comparison view?

**Note:** Scenario builder from Kanons (DSCR/Purchase/Refi) is a Sprint 2 feature —
do not merge this sprint. Just verify what's already in LO Buddy.

---

### 3F. Rate Quote Service

File: `services/rate-quote.service.ts`, `app/api/rate-quotes/`

**Audit checklist:**
- [ ] What does this service do currently?
- [ ] Is it connected to any live rate source or is it placeholder?
- [ ] Rate Stack Parser (PDF/screenshot → rate mechanism) is a Sprint 2 MVP feature — just audit what exists now

---

### 3G. Auto-Task System

Files: `services/auto-task.service.ts`, `services/auto-task.rules.ts`, `services/auto-task.rule-set.ts`

**Audit checklist:**
- [ ] Are tasks being auto-created after lead creation?
- [ ] Do follow-up tasks appear after status transitions?
- [ ] Is the task list visible in the UI?

---

## Part 4: Audit Output Document

When the audit is complete, Chad should produce a document:
`AUDIT-RESULTS-02-26.md` (place in `/data/shared/projects/lo-buddy/02-26-26/`)

Format:
```markdown
# LO Buddy Audit Results — [Date]

## Working ✅
- [feature]: confirmed working, [brief note on how verified]

## Partially Working ⚠️
- [feature]: [what works, what doesn't, what's unwired]

## Not Working / Broken ❌
- [feature]: [what's wrong]

## Not Connected (built but not wired) 🔌
- [feature]: [exists but not called anywhere]

## Missing Entirely 🚫
- [feature]: [not built at all]
```

This document becomes the source of truth for Sprint 2 prioritization.

---

## Part 5: Call Transcription from LO Ninja (New Build — Sprint 1)

This is a new feature Kyle confirmed in the hopper. Not currently in any plan.

**Goal:** Pull call recordings stored in LO Ninja → transcribe → add to client context.

**Architecture:**
1. GHL stores call recordings as audio file URLs in contact activity
2. LO Buddy fetches the recording URL via GHL API
3. Passes audio to Whisper for transcription
4. Stores transcription as a note on the opportunity + as a Pinecone memory vector

**New files needed:**
- `services/call-transcription.service.ts`
  - `fetchCallRecordings(contactId: string, teamId: string): Promise<CallRecording[]>`
  - `transcribeAndStore(recording: CallRecording, opportunityId: string): Promise<void>`

**GHL endpoint for call recordings:**
```
GET /contacts/{contactId}/activities
```
Filter for `type: 'call'` entries that have `recording_url`.

**Transcription flow:**
```typescript
const recordings = await ghl.getContactActivities(ghlContactId, { type: 'call' });
for (const call of recordings.filter(r => r.recording_url)) {
  const transcript = await whisper.transcribe(call.recording_url);
  await opportunityService.addNote(opportunityId, {
    content: `Call transcript (${call.date}): ${transcript}`,
    type: 'call_transcript',
    source: 'lo_ninja_auto'
  });
  await memoryWriteService.store(transcript, teamId, { opportunityId, type: 'call_log' });
}
```

**Trigger:** When an LO opens an opportunity detail page, check for new unsynced
call recordings and auto-transcribe them in the background.

**Dependencies:** GHL API access must be confirmed working (Part 3C) before this is built.

---

## What Is NOT In This Sprint

- Scenario builder from Kanons → Sprint 2
- Rate Stack Parser (PDF/screenshot → rates) → Sprint 2
- Pinecone memory full build (if not already wired) → Sprint 2, use JASPER-PINECONE-PORT.md
- Onboarding wizard → Sprint 3
- Multi-team rollout → Sprint 3
- Any UI redesign beyond voice reconciliation → Sprint 2+

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Sprint 1 Complete

- [ ] Bug 1 fixed: no more duplicate leads
- [ ] Bug 2 fixed: realtor fuzzy match requires both first + last name
- [ ] Bug 3 fixed: AI prompts for realtor referral after lead creation
- [ ] Bug 4 confirmed/fixed: navigation works after lead creation
- [ ] One unified voice chat UI (pink blob reconciled)
- [ ] Audit document produced with definitive status of all major systems
- [ ] GHL webhook endpoint exists and receiving events (or confirmed not yet built)
- [ ] Call transcription service built and wired to GHL (if GHL API confirmed working)
- [ ] No regressions on confirmed-working features (scenarios, context retention, DTI)

---

## Test Protocol (Run After Each Fix)

1. **Lead creation:** "New lead: Sarah Johnson, purchase" → 1 contact created, AI asks for referral
2. **Duplicate prevention:** Add info about Sarah in 3 follow-up messages → still 1 contact
3. **Realtor:** "Referred by realtor Chad Anderson" → Chad Anderson created (not Chad Test)
4. **Navigation:** Confirm browser navigates to opportunity detail after creation
5. **Voice:** Record a 10-second voice message → confirm it transcribes and processes correctly
6. **Scenario:** "Give me a conventional purchase scenario, $600k, 20% down, 740 FICO" → scenario appears
7. **Context:** Ask about something unrelated, then ask about Sarah → Sarah's context is retained
