# Trumpet Microphone Comparison — By Mount Type

_Three approaches to mic'ing a trumpet. Side by side._

---

## 1. Bell Clip Mics

Clips directly onto the bell rim. Most common, easiest setup, but adds mass to the bell which can dampen vibration and affect tone.

### DPA 4099 CORE+ — $590 (mic only)
- **Type:** Supercardioid condenser
- **The case:** Industry gold standard. Used by top orchestral and jazz players. DPA's clip is less obtrusive than most — praised for preserving tone better than other bell clips. Handles extreme SPL. CORE+ tech for cleaner signal.
- **Wireless:** Separate purchase — Shure GLXD14+ (~$450) or SLXD14 (~$600)
- **Total wireless cost:** ~$1,000–1,200
- **Downside:** Expensive. Still a bell clip at the end of the day.

### Shure Beta 98 H/C — ~$250 (mic only)
- **Type:** Cardioid condenser
- **The case:** The workhorse. Most commonly provided clip-on at venues. Easy ecosystem — Shure sells wireless bundle deals. Reliable, not flashy.
- **Wireless:** Shure GLXD14+ (~$450) or SLXD14 (~$600)
- **Total wireless cost:** ~$600–850
- **Downside:** Sound less refined than DPA. Bell clip dampens vibration.

### AKG C519 — ~$200–250
- **Type:** Cardioid condenser
- **The case:** Some pros say it sounds slightly clearer than the Shure. Solid mid-range.
- **Wireless:** Separate system required
- **Downside:** AKG wireless has reliability complaints.

### Sennheiser e908 — ~$250–300
- **Type:** Cardioid condenser
- **The case:** Good quality from Sennheiser. Less common in trumpet world.
- **Wireless:** Sennheiser EW-D system

## 2. Off-Bell Mics

Clips to tubing or leadpipe — NOT the bell. Zero impact on bell vibration. Best tone preservation. Preferred by players who are picky about their sound.

### AMT P800 — ~$400–600 (mic only)
- **Type:** Clips to tubing
- **The case:** The go-to for players who hate bell clips. A Reddit touring pro (u/Felt_Ninja, moderator of r/trumpet) uses this as his primary. Zero bell interference = your horn sounds like your horn.
- **Wireless:** Separate Shure/Sennheiser system
- **Total wireless cost:** ~$850–1,100
- **Downside:** Bulkier than bell clips. Less common so harder to demo.

### SD Systems LCM77 — ~$400–500 (mic only)
- **Type:** Off-bell clip
- **The case:** Clean sound, professional look, off-bell design. Looks sleek on stage.
- **Wireless:** Separate Shure/Sennheiser system
- **Total wireless cost:** ~$850–1,100
- **Downside:** Trumpet only — can NOT be used on flugelhorn (SD makes a separate flugel mic). More expensive.

## 3. Dual / Flexible Mount

Can be mounted ON or OFF the bell depending on preference and the gig. Best of both worlds.

### EVNO TPX2 — Price varies by package
- **Type:** High SPL condenser, trumpet-specific
- **The case:** Newer US-made brand getting serious buzz from touring pros. TPX2 offers dual mount — on OR off bell. 5.5–6.5" flex-stay gooseneck. Works with mutes (big deal). Detachable lightweight swivel clamp. A touring pro who's used Shure, AKG, Sennheiser, and AMT said EVNO had "nicer detail work on the microphones, and active market support from the company."
- **Wireless:** EVNO's own W1/Air system OR compatible with Shure, Sennheiser, AKG, McCormick
- **Packages:** Hardwired, W1 wireless, W2 dual wireless, Air wireless
- **Downside:** Newer brand (less track record). Pricing not fully transparent — need to contact them.
- **Website:** evnomicrophones.com

### EVNO TPX1 — Price varies by package
- **Type:** Same as TPX2 but bell-mount only (with detachable clamp)
- **The case:** Same quality and modularity as TPX2, just without the off-bell option. Works with mutes. Lighter setup.

## My Take

If you're leaning away from a pure bell clip, the two strongest options are:

1. **AMT P800** — Proven off-bell. The touring pro's choice. Pair with Shure GLXD14+ and you're set.
2. **EVNO TPX2** — Dual mount gives you flexibility. Newer but impressive. Their integrated wireless is the simplest path.

Worth reaching out to EVNO directly for pricing — their site doesn't list it. Could be the most elegant solution since you play across multiple bands and venues.
