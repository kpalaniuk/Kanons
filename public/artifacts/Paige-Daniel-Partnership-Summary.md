# Paige + Daniel: Partnership Roadmap
### A practical guide for structuring your design-build collaboration

---

## Where You Are Now
Separate contracts with clients. Paige handles design + heavy project management. Daniel handles construction under his own license. It works, but roles blur, authority isn't formalized, and Paige is undercharging for the PM work she's actually doing.

## The Core Problem
Paige is doing two jobs (design + project management) but only billing for one. Daniel's crews see Paige on-site constantly but she has no contractual authority over them. When issues arise, there's no clear chain of command.

---

## Recommended Path (3 Phases)

### Phase 1: Formalize What You're Already Doing (Now – 6 months)
- Keep separate contracts for current projects (don't disrupt anything in-flight)
- Create a simple **Partnership MOU** — who does what, how you communicate, how decisions get made
- Give Daniel's subs a written notice: "Paige is the Design-PM and is authorized to provide design direction and coordinate schedules"
- **Start tracking hours** on every project — this data will tell you what a fair split actually looks like
- Weekly coordination meeting (15 min, same day each week)

### Phase 2: Unified Client Contract (Months 7–18)
- New projects go under **one contract** — Daniel as prime contractor, Paige as design-PM subcontractor
- Client pays Daniel. Daniel pays Paige per your agreement.
- **Recommended split: 60% Paige / 40% Daniel** (reflects design + extensive PM role)
- Create a standard authority matrix so crews know exactly who decides what
- Build a shared brand: "Integrated design-build team" is a strong selling point

### Phase 3: Design-Build LLC (18+ months, only if Phase 2 thrives)
- Form a California LLC together
- Daniel as the licensed RME (Responsible Managing Employee)
- Set salaries + profit distribution in an operating agreement
- Ownership 50/50 or based on contribution
- **Only do this when:** you've completed 8+ projects together, trust is solid, deal flow is consistent, and you both want to build a brand

## What Paige Should Charge

Industry ranges for someone doing **both design AND project management:**
- **Design only:** 10–15% of project cost
- **Project management only:** 5–10%
- **Design + PM combined:** 15–25%

For a $250K renovation at 20% combined fee ($50K), a 60/40 split = **$30K Paige / $20K Daniel**

At $16K for 3+ months of design AND PM on Will's project, Paige is significantly below market.

## California Licensing: Does Paige Need One?

**No — not for what she's doing now.** On private residential projects, Paige can legally:
- Coordinate trades and schedules
- Make design decisions on-site
- Review work quality
- Source materials
- Manage budgets and timelines

She **cannot** (without a license): pull structural permits, enter construction contracts, or directly hire/fire subs. All of that stays under Daniel's license.

**Long-term:** If the partnership grows to 4+ projects/year, Paige getting her own Class B license (2-3 year timeline) would strengthen the business and provide backup.

## The One-Page Authority Matrix

| Decision | Paige Leads | Daniel Leads | Joint |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Design changes (within budget) | ✓ | | |
| Design changes (over 10% impact) | | | ✓ |
| Material substitutions | ✓ (design) | ✓ (cost) | |
| Schedule changes | | ✓ | Major ones |
| Sub performance issues | Reports | Manages | Termination |
| Payment releases | Quality sign-off | Releases | |
| Safety/code | | ✓ (final authority) | |
| Change orders | Design impact | Price/schedule | Client approval |

## Key Numbers to Know

- **GC markup (industry standard):** 10–20% on hard costs
- **Design-build combined fee:** 20–25% of total project
- **Referral fee (if you stay separate):** 10% standard
- **California LLC annual franchise tax:** $800 minimum
- **LLC formation cost (with attorney):** $7K–$16K total startup

## What This Means for the Will Project

This project stays as-is — separate contracts, no disruption. But use it to:
1. Track your hours carefully (both of you)
2. Practice the authority matrix informally
3. Note where confusion or gaps show up
4. After it's done, sit down and review: what worked, what didn't, what would a unified contract have changed?

Daniel should add 15–20% cushion to his estimate. He's new to bidding on his own and the numbers are tight. Better to come in under budget than scramble when overruns hit.

---

## Next Step

Schedule a casual sit-down — Paige, Daniel, and Kyle if helpful — to talk through:
1. Do we want to formalize this?
2. What does a fair split look like based on what we're each actually doing?
3. What decisions should require both of us to agree?

No rush. No pressure. Just a conversation about making something that's already working... work better for both of you.
