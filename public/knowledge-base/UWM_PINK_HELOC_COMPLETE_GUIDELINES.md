## Credit

The loan requires a tri-merge credit report for all borrowers. At least two credit scores are required per borrower. The lower of the two scores will be the qualifying FICO for the borrower. Refer to the HELOC Product Matrix for the minimum credit score requirements.

### First Lien Documentation

A recent mortgage statement (or equivalent) must be provided to document the outstanding balance, monthly payment, note rate, mortgage insurance (if present), and servicer. The escrow amount will be compared to the documented taxes and insurance to address any potential escrow shortage. If the escrow amount exceeds the taxes and insurance, the difference will be added to the mortgage payment used for qualification.

### Interest-Only First Mortgage

When the first mortgage is interest-only, the fully amortized payment must be used for qualification. Documentation such as the mortgage note must be provided evidencing the loan terms.

### Mortgage Payment History

- No late payments are allowed for any mortgage in the most recent twelve months (0x30x12) unless during a COVID-19 forbearance
- Missed payments during the forbearance period would not be considered late
- Any mortgage loan currently in forbearance must be removed prior to loan application date
- All mortgages must be current and no more than 45 days may have elapsed since the last paid installment date to the loan application date

### Derogatory Credit

Follow Fannie Mae for waiting period requirements. Extenuating circumstances are not permitted.

### Judgements/Collections/Tax Liens

Follow Fannie Mae requirements for judgments, collections, and tax liens:

**Collection Accounts:**

- **1-unit principal residence:** Borrowers are not required to pay off outstanding collections or non-mortgage charge-offs — regardless of the amount
- **2-4 unit owner-occupied and second home:** Collections and non-mortgage charge-offs totaling more than $5,000 must be paid in full prior to or at closing
- **Investment properties:** Individual collection and non-mortgage charge-off accounts equal to or greater than $250 and accounts that total more than $1,000 must be paid in full prior to or at closing

**Judgments/Tax Liens:**

Open judgments/tax liens and all outstanding liens that are in the Public Records section of the credit report must be paid off at or prior to closing.

### Real Estate Owned (REO) Expenses

If tax returns are being utilized to document the taxes and insurance for non-subject properties, the returns must be for the most recent calendar year. If the borrower has not filed the most recent calendar year of tax returns, current documentation must be provided. Property tax and insurance documentation from the current calendar year must always be used, when provided.

**Example:** A loan closing in 2024 has an REO. The mortgage statement for the REO indicates that taxes and insurance are not escrowed. Additionally, rental income is being used from the same REO. The borrower has filed an extension for the 2023 tax returns and provides the 2022 tax returns to calculate the income. The 1040s from 2022 are NOT acceptable for documenting current expenses. More current documentation from 2023/2024 is required.

---

## Income Requirements

Income produced, or in relation to, cannabis, hemp, or the adult entertainment industry is not permitted.

The following guidance also applies:

- The loan file must follow standard Fannie Mae guidelines in regards to documentation standards
- Tax transcripts are not required. Transcripts are only needed if being used as standalone income documentation

**Salary, variable, and secondary employment:**

- Unexpired paystub or Written VOE and most recent 2 years W-2s, OR
- Written VOE covering most recent 2 years
- A year-end paystub can be used in lieu of a W-2 only if the W-2 is not yet available. The loan must close by 1/31 in order to utilize this option.

**Self-employment:**

- 2 years' signed tax returns and business returns (when applicable)
- VOBs must be dated within 10 business days of closing

---

## Asset Requirements

The borrower must utilize the HELOC Draw Amount towards closing costs/funds to close. The transaction cannot require the borrower to bring funds to closing.

---

## Title Requirements

The following documents are permitted:

- **Full title report documents** (wire instructions, title commitment, and closing protection letter required)
- **Limited Title policy** (Master Home Equity or HELOC Policy with wire instructions and closing protection letter required), OR
- **Ownership & Encumbrance report** (wire instructions required) from approved title company
  - This report expires after 60 days

For all title options, the loan must close and fund with an approved Title/Escrow company. Additionally, all borrowers must be vested on title at the time of the loan application.

The subject property cannot be owned free and clear. There must be a mortgage payment for the subject property and the subject HELOC must be in second lien position. Subordinate financing (i.e. a mortgage subordinated to the subject loan) is not permitted. Additional subordinate mortgage liens must be paid off and/or closed.

---

## HOI Replacement Cost

Replacement cost must be documented when the dwelling coverage from the homeowner's insurance policy is less than the sum of the outstanding balance of the first lien and the total line amount of the HELOC.

---

## Property Valuation Requirements

### Total Line Amount Less Than or Equal to (≤) $400K

One of the following valuations may be accepted to document the subject property value:

1. **Full appraisal** dated within four months of the note date

2. **Exterior-only appraisal** (Fannie Mae Form 2055 or 1075)
   - Only available for one unit SFRs/Condos/PUDs
   - If the subject property already has a full appraisal provided, an exterior-only appraisal value cannot be used (the value from a full un-expired appraisal would supersede the valuation)

3. **Automated Valuation Model (AVM)** obtained by UWM
   - AVM must be completed within one month of the note date
   - If the subject property already has a full appraisal provided, an AVM value cannot be used (the value from a full un-expired appraisal would supersede the AVM's valuation)

**AVM FSD Score Requirements:**

| AVM Provider | Line ≤ $250K | Line > $250K |
|---|---|---|
| HouseCanary | FSD ≤ 0.20 | FSD ≤ 0.10 |
| Clear Capital | FSD ≤ 0.20 | FSD ≤ 0.13 |
| Collateral Analytics | FSD ≤ 0.18 | FSD ≤ 0.10 |

### Total Line Amount Greater than (>) $400K

- A full appraisal completed within 4 months of the note date is required
- A Recertification of Value is acceptable if completed within 12 months of note date and meets or exceeds the original value
- A new appraisal will be required if original appraisal was completed greater than 12 months from note date

### Appraisal Re-Use

The Standalone HELOC can re-use an appraisal from a previous transaction as long as the following is met:

- The primary/first lien is a UWM mortgage
- Appraisal is a UWM appraisal
- The appraisal is no older than 6 months as of the Note date, AND
- If the appraisal is more than 4 months old but less than 6 months as of the Note date, a recertification of value is required. The 1004D must meet Fannie Mae guidelines.
