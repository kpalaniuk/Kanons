# Fannie Mae Quick Reference Guide

## Income Documentation (B3-3.1 through B3-3.4)

### W-2 / Salary Income (B3-3.1-01)
- Most recent 30-day paystub + most recent 2 years W-2s
- Year-to-date earnings should be consistent with prior years
- If YTD shows significant increase/decrease, analyze and document reason

### Variable Income (B3-3.1-01)
**Overtime, Bonus, Commission < 25% of total income:**
- 2-year history required to establish pattern
- Use 2-year average (or declining trend analysis)
- Must be likely to continue

**Commission ≥ 25% of total income (B3-3.2-01):**
- Most recent 2 years tax returns required
- Treated as self-employed for documentation purposes

### Self-Employment Income (B3-3.2-01)
- 2 years tax returns (personal + business)
- Must own ≥ 25% of business
- Calculate using IRS Form analysis:
  - **Sole Prop (Sched C):** Net profit + depreciation

  - **Partnership (1065):** K-1 ordinary income + guaranteed payments + depreciation (pro-rata)
  - **C-Corp (1120):** W-2 only (corp income stays in corp) — unless borrower is 100% owner, then can add after-tax corp income
