# Income Calculation Cheatsheet

## W-2 Salary (Stable Employment)

```
Monthly Income = Annual Salary / 12
  — OR —
Monthly Income = (YTD Gross / # months worked) verified against W-2 history
```

**Docs:** 30-day paystub + 2 years W-2s

---

## Hourly Employee

```
If consistent hours:
  Monthly Income = Hourly Rate × Weekly Hours × 52 / 12

If variable hours:
  Monthly Income = (2-Year Total Gross) / 24
  — OR —
  Monthly Income = (YTD Gross / pay periods) × pay periods per month
  → Use the lower of the two methods if declining
```

**Docs:** 30-day paystub + 2 years W-2s

---

## Overtime / Bonus

```
Monthly OT/Bonus = (Year 1 OT + Year 2 OT) / 24

If current year significantly different:
  → Compare YTD annualized to prior years
  → Use declining trend if applicable
  → Must have 2-year history to use
```

**Key:** Must be "likely to continue" — if employer states OT ending, cannot use.

---

## Commission (< 25% of gross)

```
Monthly Commission = (Year 1 + Year 2) / 24
```

**Docs:** 30-day paystub + 2 years W-2s

---

## Commission (≥ 25% of gross) — Treated as Self-Employed

```
Same as self-employment calculation below
```

**Docs:** 2 years tax returns (1040 + Schedules)

---

## Self-Employment — Sole Proprietor (Schedule C)

```
Year 1:
  Net Profit (Line 31)
  + Depreciation (Line 13)
  + Depletion (Line 12)
  + Business Use of Home (Line 30, Form 8829)
  - Amortization/Casualty Loss (if one-time add-back applies)
  = Adjusted Year 1

Year 2: Same calculation

Monthly Income = (Adjusted Year 1 + Adjusted Year 2) / 24

If declining: Use the lower year (or trending analysis per investor)
```

---

## Self-Employment — S-Corp (1120S + K-1)

```
W-2 Income from S-Corp
+ K-1 Ordinary Income (Box 1)
+ Depreciation (from 1120S, pro-rata to ownership %)
- Depletion
- Mortgage/Notes Payable (< 1 year — deduct from income as obligation)
= Adjusted Year Total

Monthly = (Year 1 + Year 2) / 24
```

**Important:** Only add depreciation if borrower owns ≥ 25%. Distributions are NOT income — they're return of equity.

---

## Self-Employment — Partnership (1065 + K-1)

```
K-1 Ordinary Income (Box 1)
+ Guaranteed Payments (Box 4)
+ Depreciation (from 1065, pro-rata to ownership %)
- Depletion
- Mortgage/Notes Payable (< 1 year)
= Adjusted Year Total

Monthly = (Year 1 + Year 2) / 24
```

---

## Self-Employment — C-Corp (1120)

```
W-2 Income (primary source)

If 100% owner AND income needed:
  + After-tax corporate income (Line 30 - Line 31 taxes)
  + Depreciation
  - Depletion
  BUT: Must demonstrate funds available to borrower
  (check cash position, retained earnings, distributions)

Monthly = (Year 1 + Year 2) / 24
```

**Caution:** C-Corp income is rarely added. Most underwriters only use W-2.

---

## Rental Income — Schedule E Method

```
Per Property from Schedule E:
  Net Income (or Loss)
  + Depreciation
  + Interest
  + Taxes
  + Insurance
  + HOA (if deducted)
  = Adjusted Rental Income

Monthly = Annual / 12

If negative: Counts as a monthly liability
```

---

## Rental Income — Lease Method (Not on Returns)

```
Monthly Income = Gross Monthly Rent × 75%
— Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac

Monthly Income = Gross Monthly Rent × 75% - PITIA
— FHA (net added to income if positive, or to liabilities if negative)
```

**Subject property (purchase):** Use appraiser's market rent (Form 1007/1025)

---

## DSCR (Non-QM Investment)

```
DSCR = Monthly Gross Rent / Monthly PITIA

DSCR ≥ 1.25 = Strong
DSCR ≥ 1.00 = Minimum (most investors)
DSCR 0.75-0.99 = Some investors allow, higher rate
```

**No personal income needed.** Qualify on property cash flow only.

---

## Social Security / Pension / Disability

```
Monthly Income = Award letter amount

If non-taxable (verify with tax returns or benefit letter):
  Grossed-up Income = Award Amount × 1.25
  (Fannie/Freddie/FHA all allow 25% gross-up)
```

---

## Alimony / Child Support

```
Monthly Income = Court-ordered amount
  → Must continue for ≥ 3 years from note date
  → Must document 6-12 months consistent receipt (program dependent)
```

---

## Asset Depletion / Asset Dissipation (Fannie B3-4.3-09)

```
Eligible Assets (after down payment, closing costs, required reserves)
÷ Remaining Loan Term (months)
= Monthly Income

Eligible: 100% checking/savings, 70% stocks/bonds, 60% retirement
NOT eligible: business assets, gift funds, proceeds from subject transaction
```

---

## Quick DTI Calculation

```
Front-End DTI = (Proposed PITIA) / Gross Monthly Income × 100
Back-End DTI = (Proposed PITIA + All Monthly Obligations) / Gross Monthly Income × 100

Monthly Obligations include:
  - Minimum credit card payments
  - Auto/student/personal loan payments
  - Alimony/child support PAID
  - Other RE PITIA (if not positive rental income)
  - 0.5% of deferred student loan balance (FHA)
  - 5% of collections balance (FHA, if not paying off)
```

---

## Reserves Calculation

```
Months of Reserves = Liquid Assets / Monthly PITIA

Liquid Assets:
  - Checking/Savings: 100%
  - Stocks/Bonds: 70% (after capital gains tax discount)
  - Retirement (vested): 60%
  - Cash value life insurance: Net cash value
```
